# Project Handover: Holiday Planner Next.js Migration

## Project Overview

We are working on two related projects:

1. **Reference Project (Original)**: 
   - Located at `holiday/`
   - Original React implementation
   - Contains the working vacation planner application
   - Will serve as the reference for the app functionality

2. **New Project (Next.js Migration)**:
   - Located at `holiday-planner-next/`
   - Next.js 14 implementation
   - Currently focusing on static pages for SEO optimization
   - Repository: https://github.com/seppelz/holiday-planner-next

## Current Status

### Completed:
- Set up Next.js project structure
- Migrated and enhanced StatePage component with:
  - Seasonal animations
  - Responsive design
  - Performance optimizations
  - SEO improvements
- Implemented proper CSS organization with modules
- Created base layout and navigation
- Set up GitHub repository

### In Progress:
- Landing page implementation
- StatePage refinements
- SEO optimizations for static pages

### Next Steps:
1. Complete the landing page implementation
2. Finalize the StatePage component
3. Implement static pages (Impressum, Datenschutz, etc.)
4. Begin app functionality migration

## Important Notes

### SEO Strategy
- Static pages (Landing, State, Legal) use Next.js static generation
- App section will remain client-side rendered
- Focus on metadata, performance, and accessibility

### Migration Strategy
1. First Phase (Current):
   - Focus on static pages that benefit from SEO
   - Implement with Next.js static generation
   - Optimize for search engines

2. Second Phase (Upcoming):
   - Migrate app functionality exactly as is
   - Use reference project as source of truth
   - No need to change app logic or optimize for SEO
   - Keep dynamic functionality client-side

### Key Files
- `StatePage.tsx`: Main state information page
- `StatePage.module.css`: Styling for state page
- `LandingPage.tsx`: Homepage (in progress)
- Original app components will be migrated as-is

### Technical Decisions
- Use CSS Modules for styling
- Implement responsive design
- Optimize animations and transitions
- Keep app functionality identical to reference

## Reference Project Notes
- The original app works perfectly
- No need to modify app logic
- Use as exact reference for functionality
- Keep all features and behaviors identical

## Next Steps
1. Complete static pages with SEO optimization
2. Test and verify static page performance
3. Begin app migration without modifications
4. Maintain separation between static and dynamic parts

Remember: The goal is to have the best of both worlds:
- Optimized, static pages for marketing and information
- Dynamic, client-side app for the vacation planner
